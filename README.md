## Node and Computor

The prerequisite for becoming a Computor is to run a Qubic node and obtain enough points. It takes a week to obtain Computor status. Only Computors can receive rewards.

#### AlienPool Miner

According to my understanding, AlienPool is actually more like a tool to improve the score of Qubic nodes and help your nodes become Computors.

The prerequisite for using AlienPool is that you must run at least one node, because the Solutions mined by AlienPool will be used to improve the score of the node.
