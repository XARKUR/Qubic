Simply help everyone quickly understand the Qubic reward method.



## Node and Computor

Qubic allows up to **676** Computors. The prerequisite for becoming a Computor is to run a Qubic node and obtain enough scores and rank among the top **676**. You will be listed as a candidate in the first week. If you are qualified to become a Computor, you will receive benefits in the next week, with a maximum of **1.4** billion QUBIC per epoch (week).

## Miner

#### Qubic-li Miner

> Official library : [qubic-li/client (github.com)](https://github.com/qubic-li/client)

Qubic.li offers a client that can be used to mine QUBIC. This software is user-friendly, has Windows and Linux versions, and supports Docker. making it a good choice for those new to mining. It provides essential features like managing your mining activity, monitoring performance, and connecting with the Qubic network.

#### AlienPool Miner

According to my understanding, AlienPool is actually more like a tool to improve the score of Qubic nodes and help your nodes become Computor.

The prerequisite for using AlienPool is that you must run at least one node, because the Solutions mined by AlienPool will be used to improve the score of the node.
